The _Screenshots_ package allows you to automatically take full screenshots of every page on your site. If your site is [tagged for translation](/i18n/setup/), this also builds a visual mapping between your tags and the screenshots, so you can review translated content with ease.

### Features

* Quickly review the look of your entire site after a build.
* Easily search through your i18n tags as they appear on your pages.
