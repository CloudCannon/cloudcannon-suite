					<p>Welcome to the install guide. If you have your development machine setup, this guide will go through updating your site structure and adding basic packages.</p>
					<h3>Prepare source</h3>
					<p>A custom source directory keeps the root directory clean and free for configuration. Move all jekyll source including Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to the <code>src</code> folder. To do this with bash use the following command:<br /><code>$ mkdir src<br />$ mv `ls -A | grep -v src` ./src</code></p>
					<p>If you don't want to use the command line, this can be done in finder/explorer.</p>
					<h3>Create a package.json in your project directory</h3>
					<p>If you don't have a package.json, create one. If you need help, run an <code>npm init </code>which will walk you through giving it a name, version, description, etc.<br /><code>$ npm init</code></p>
					<h3>Install your dependencies</h3>
					<p>Run this command in your project directory:<br /><code>$ npm install --save-dev gulp@next cloudcannon-suite</code></p>
					<h3>Create a gulpfile.js</h3>
					<p>In your project directory, create a file named <code>gulpfile.js</code> in your project root with these contents:<br /><code>const gulp = require("gulp");<br />const suite = require("cloudcannon-suite");</code></p>
					<p><code>suite.jekyllDev(gulp);</code></p>
					<h3>Test your suite</h3>
					<p>Run the gulp command in your project directory:<br /><code>$ gulp dev</code></p>
					<p>If you run into any issues, check your folder structure matches the [suite structure](/structure/).</p>
					<h3>Result</h3>
					<p>Voila! This will build your site to <code>dist/site</code> and serve it on localhost:4000. Any changes made in <code>src</code> will trigger another build.<br /><code>$ gulp dev<br />[19:14:48] Using gulpfile ~/Work/cloudcannon/suite/gulpfile.js<br />[19:14:48] Starting 'dev'...<br />[19:14:48] Starting 'dev:build'...<br />[19:14:48] $ bundle exec jekyll build --destination dist/site<br />Configuration file: src/_config.yml<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Source: src<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Destination: dist/src<br />&nbsp;Incremental build: disabled.
